## Java
This section include flow of Java topics and its concept with problems.
- Intro to Java
- Data types & Variables
- Conditionals & Loops
- Functions
- OOPs
## Data Structures

This section includes Java implementations of various data structures, including:

- Arrays & Array List
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

Each data structure comes with detailed documentation, usage examples, and explanations of **time and space complexity**.

## Algorithms

In this section, you'll find Java implementations of fundamental algorithms, such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion

The implementations are accompanied by clear explanations, code walkthroughs, and analysis of time and space complexity.

## Problem Solutions

Here, you'll find solutions to popular DSA problems and coding challenges. The solutions are organized by category, such as arrays, strings, graphs, and more. Each solution includes detailed explanations, step-by-step approaches, and the corresponding Java code.

**Note** : This folder will contain only problems from SDE SHEET and top companies questions.

## Contest Problems and Solutions

A collection of carefully curated programming contest problems and their solutions. Sharpen your coding skills by practicing these challenging problems and exploring the provided solutions. Level up your problem-solving abilities and prepare for coding competitions with confidence.

## Tutorials and Guides

The Tutorials and Guides section offers in-depth explanations of DSA concepts, Java-specific tips, best practices, and optimization techniques. These tutorials and guides aim to enhance your understanding of DSA principles and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Resources

This section provides a curated list of external resources for further learning and exploration of DSA concepts using Java. You'll find recommended books, online courses, video tutorials, and websites that can supplement your understanding and help you dive deeper into the subject.
